# PHPSchemaManager auto test scripts

The idea is to place here all scripts used to automatically test the library.
To execute the automated tests, you can use one of the scripts available for windows or linux.
Just copy the smauto.bat or smauto.sh into your user directory (or any other directory of your preference) and execute it.

You will notice that these a re very simple scripts.
They will remove the existing library directory, download the library code directly from github and then call the PHP script created to execute the tests.
